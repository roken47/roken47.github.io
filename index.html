        Hi, welcome! Please browse my creations here from
        <a href="https://github.com/roken47" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>
        <br />
        I will include a few links to school assessments as they come and the
        directly shared ones are mostly finished.

        Nothing else worthy comes to mind to say in the moments of structuring
        this page...
